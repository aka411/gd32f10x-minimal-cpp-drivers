# gd32f10x-minimal-cpp-drivers
Modern C++ Peripheral Drivers for GD32F10x Microcontrollers (Minimalistic, Type-Safe, Zero-Overhead)

This repository provides a set of lightweight, type-safe, and highly efficient C++ drivers for the GD32F10x series of microcontrollers. Designed for bare-metal embedded development, this library focuses on delivering a minimalistic Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that leverages modern C++ features to provide robust and readable control over the MCU's peripherals without incurring unnecessary runtime overhead.
